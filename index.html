        <h1>Secret Santa!</h1>  
        <div>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This will have a randomizer that lets you input names, phone numbers, and constraints. It will then randomize the list and send out a text to everyone with the name of who they got paired with.
              </li>
              <li>
                This will have a sign in option to allow users to sign into a group. If a user elects to make a group, it will:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Send a text to each user with a notification that there number was used to create an account. 
                    If they wish to have it removed, they can opt out and it will remove them from the db and group and alert the group that the person has left.
                    When they go to sign in, they will have to enter the group name. This will trigger a text with an authentication didgit.
                    They sign in the first time with that?
                    Idk, I don't want the security to be an issue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Store matched name list in db.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Store first names in db and phone numbers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Store password, username, and groupname.
                  </li>
                  <li>
